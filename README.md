# Hezane

This repository contains a static portfolio website built with plain HTML and CSS. The site is published using **GitHub Pages**, making it easy to showcase your work online.

## Local Development

To preview the site locally run a small HTTP server and open your browser:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` to view the homepage.

## Deployment

The repository includes a `.nojekyll` file so that GitHub Pages serves the files exactly as provided without applying Jekyll processing.
